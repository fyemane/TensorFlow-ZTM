# TensorFlow-ZTM
The projects I completed while enrolled in Zero to Mastery's TensorFlow Developer Certificate in 2023: Zero to Mastery. 

This course made me take a deep dive into the machine learning algorithms TensorFlow has to offer. 

Some of the areas I explored are regression, classification, transfer learning, natural language processing, and time series fundamentals. These areas required a variety of neural networks and techniques to optimize them.
